**Customer Segmentation Project**
-----------------------------------------
**Introduction**
-----------------------------------------
This project aims to segment customers of a retail store using K-means clustering based on their demographic and spending behavior. The dataset includes information such as Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

-----------------------------------------
**Files**
-----------------------------------------
1)customer_data.csv: CSV file containing the customer data.
2)customer_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and clustering.

-----------------------------------------
**Dependencies**
-----------------------------------------
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

1)pandas
2)matplotlib
3)scikit-learn
4)You can install these dependencies using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn.

-----------------------------------------

**Usage**
-----------------------------------------
1)Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2)Open the Jupyter Notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
3)Run each cell in the notebook to load the data, perform data analysis, and apply K-means clustering.
4)Analyze the clusters and interpret the results based on customer segments.

-----------------------------------------

**Data Description**
-----------------------------------------

1)Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
2)Age: Age of the customer.
3)Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
4)Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
5)Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned to the customer based on purchasing behavior and other factors.

-----------------------------------------

**Results**
-----------------------------------------
The project will generate clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score. These clusters can be used to identify target customer segments and plan marketing strategies accordingly.
